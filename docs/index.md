# feature-reviser
## Introduction
The feature-reviser makes it easier to find the right features for a classifier.
After creating different features, the question often arises whether they improve or worsen the performance of the classifier and thus have a direct positive or negative influence on the prediction. This project is intended to simplify the selection of features and at the same time contribute to simplifying and automating the entire processing process.
